# 🌆 WattWatch  
## Analyzing Urban Energy Consumption for Smarter Cities ⚡

---

## 📌 Project Introduction

Modern cities generate huge amounts of energy consumption data through smart meters installed across residential, commercial, and industrial areas.  
The **WattWatch** project analyzes this data to understand how energy is consumed across different zones of a city and how it impacts cost, reliability, and sustainability.

This project focuses on **urban energy intelligence** and provides **data-driven insights** to help city planners and utility providers make smarter decisions.

## 🔹 Analytical Scope

### 1️⃣ Zone-wise Energy Consumption Analysis

This analysis identifies how energy usage varies across different city zones.  
It helps determine:

- Which zones consume the most energy  
- Where infrastructure upgrades are needed  
- How population and commercial activity affect energy demand  

---

### 2️⃣ Consumer Type Analysis

Energy usage is analyzed based on consumer categories:

- Residential  
- Commercial  
- Industrial  

This helps understand which consumer group contributes the most to overall consumption and revenue.

---

### 3️⃣ Monthly & Seasonal Trend Analysis

Energy consumption is analyzed on a monthly basis to identify:

- Seasonal usage patterns  
- Peak demand periods  
- Summer vs non-summer energy behavior  

---

### 4️⃣ Cost & Tariff Impact Analysis

This section evaluates how tariff rates influence:

- Total energy cost per zone  
- Revenue generation  
- Cost burden across consumers  

---

### 5️⃣ Reliability & Outage Analysis

This analysis focuses on:

- Faulty meters  
- Frequency of power outages  
- Average outage duration per zone  

It helps identify zones with poor infrastructure reliability.
